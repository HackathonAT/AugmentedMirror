# AugmentedMirror
Use Case 3 / Augmented Mirror

Welcome to the Capgemini Hackathon!
Most of the framework is already provided:
Webcam connection and Video Frame grab as well as the hybris REST interface.

To implement the augmented Mirror, you need to:
1. Send grabbed images in MainWindow.xaml.cs to the APIs (Face API, Emotion API, Vision API)
2. Send your target group to hybris (HybrisRest.cs) and recieve an Ad URL
3. Show the Ad on the screen.

Happy hacking! - Mirko
